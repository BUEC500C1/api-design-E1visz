## Project Mission

Provide the realtime weather of the airport, which contains the temperature, feels like, humidity, pressure, etc.

## User stories

I, as a traveler, would like to use this API to get the weather information of the airport to make sure the journey goes well.   

I, as a ground crew, would like to use this API to get the weather imformation of the airport in case of the negative influence of the bad weather.  

## Architecture Needed

* Python code running on computer.    

* OpenweatherMap API.  

* Requests(python module).

## Test Case

1. I, as a ground crew in Cass Field, I want to know whether today's weather is good for airplane to take off.
